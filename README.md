# FPGA

This repository contains Verilog code for several components written during the course of FPGA using Verilog taught by [Dr. Nabi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BKPQVhgAAAAJ&hl=en) at Isfahan University of Technology. The components included in this repository are:

8-bit Full Adder
Day Counter
Multiplexer
PWM
Synchronous Transmitter
Synchronous Receiver

## Components

### 8-bit Full Adder
The 8-bit full adder is a combinational circuit that adds two 8-bit binary numbers and produces a sum output and a carry output. 

### Day Counter
The day counter is a sequential circuit that counts the number of days in a month. 

### Multiplexer
The multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of several input signals and outputs it. 

### PWM
The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) module generates a square wave signal with varying duty cycle. 

### Synchronous Transmitter
The synchronous transmitter is a sequential circuit that transmits data to a receiver using a synchronous protocol. 

### Synchronous Receiver
The synchronous receiver is a sequential circuit that receives data from a transmitter using a synchronous protocol.
